## Features

This mod adds over 200 new items and blocks into Minecraft, with progression built to last over six hours of standard gameplay.
We are always growing features with regular updates planned, so please stay tuned and submit your requests for features at our GitHub repository, featured below.

## Downloads

This mod is currently available for Minecraft 1.16.1, used with the Forge Mod Loader, and can be downloaded from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/assembly-line-machines), or [Directly](https://www.haydenb.me/alm/latest.php) from my website. Please note that these two locations are the only two officially available versions of this mod at this time, and thus any redistribution websites shall not be considered official, and therefore will not receive support.

## Synergies

I strongly recommend playing with [Just Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) installed. This client-side mod helps with knowing both crafting recipes and other related in-game knowledge regarding this mod.
## Issues

If you have an issue with this mod, want advice, or simply want to make a suggestion, use our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/HaydenBelanger/assembly_line_machines/issues) to do this! We will do our best to respond, but we are just two people at this time, and therefore we won't be able to get back to everybody as fast as we'd like to.
